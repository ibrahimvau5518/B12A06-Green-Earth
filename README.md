1) Difference between var, let, and const:
In JavaScript, var is function-scoped, can be redeclared and reassigned, and is hoisted to the top of its function scope. let is block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope, and is hoisted with a temporal dead zone, meaning it cannot be accessed before declaration. const is also block-scoped and hoisted with a temporal dead zone, but it cannot be reassigned or redeclared. However, objects and arrays declared with const can have their contents modified, even though the variable itself cannot point to a new value.

2) Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter():
forEach() is used to iterate over each element in an array but does not return a new array. map() is used to transform each element and returns a new array containing the transformed values. filter() is used to select elements that satisfy a condition and returns a new array containing only those elements. These methods are commonly used for functional programming patterns in JavaScript and help write cleaner and more readable code compared to traditional loops.

3) Arrow functions in ES6:
Arrow functions provide a shorter and more concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. Unlike traditional functions, arrow functions do not have their own this context and instead inherit this from the surrounding scope. They cannot be used as constructors and are especially useful for callbacks, array methods, and functional programming. Arrow functions can omit the return keyword for single-expression functions, making the code more compact and readable.

4) Destructuring assignment in ES6:
Destructuring assignment allows extracting values from arrays or properties from objects into individual variables in a single statement. This makes the code cleaner and reduces the need to repeatedly reference the array or object. It can be used for function parameters, nested objects, and default values, making it a powerful feature for handling complex data structures in a concise and readable way.

5) Template literals in ES6:
Template literals use backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes and allow embedding expressions directly within strings using ${}. They also support multi-line strings without the need for concatenation. Compared to traditional string concatenation, template literals make the code more readable, maintainable, and easier to write, especially when combining variables and dynamic expressions within strings.
